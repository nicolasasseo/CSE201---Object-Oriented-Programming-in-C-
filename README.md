# Overview
- This repository contains all the assignments from my CSE201 - Object Oriented Programming in C++ course from 2nd year. 

- The first two labs were in C, and aimed to introduce to the new syntax after transitioning from mainly using Python. 

- The rest of the labs are in C++, and aimed to introduce all the features of C++ (pointers, structures and classes, templates, etc)
